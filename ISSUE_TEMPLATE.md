Do not open an issue for the following:

1. the bot does not run
2. the bot runs but quits immediately after the print statements
3. I ran the bot and lost all my money

This code is **intentionally broken** to prevent people from blindly running it,
and I'm not providing support.

It trades with the Coinbase API which has very high fees compared to GDAX, and the
EMA "quit while you're ahead" strategy is provably broken.  Please use it only as
as starting template for your own bot, or look elsewhere.
